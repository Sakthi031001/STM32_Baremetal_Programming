STM32F446RE Bare-Metal Programming Exercises
This repository contains my work as I progress through the Udemy course Advanced Embedded Systems Bare-Metal Programming Ground Up. My goal is to develop a strong foundation in writing bare-metal drivers and firmware in Embedded C for the STM32F446RE microcontroller, with each exercise aimed at direct hardware interaction and driver development.

Skills and Topics Covered
The course covers various fundamental and advanced topics in embedded systems programming, with exercises including:

Bare-Metal Embedded C Programming: Writing low-level code directly to hardware registers.
DMA (Direct Memory Access) Drivers: Creating drivers for memory-to-memory, ADC, PWM, UART, SPI, and I2C transfers.
Real-Time Clock (RTC) and Watchdog Timers: Implementing RTC for time-keeping applications, along with Independent and Windowed Watchdog Timers for system stability.
Low Power Modes: Drivers for entering Standby mode and setting up wake-up procedures.
Debugger Proficiency: Analyzing and troubleshooting code execution using debugging tools.

Future Plans
Once I complete the course, I plan to develop an environment monitoring system as a real-world application of my embedded systems knowledge. Updates will be added as I progress.
